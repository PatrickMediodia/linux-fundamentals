- staging directory
- `/tmp` - cleared out on system boot
- `/var/tmp` 
	- content persists on system boot
	- usually cleared every 30 days (depends on the distro)
- `mktemp <filename/dir+filename>` - creates a random file
	- example commands
	- `mktemp sample.XXX` - will result in a file created with the name sample and 3 random letters after it

Symbolic Links
- `ln -s <target> <link name>`
	- `ln` - link
	- `-s` - symbolic
- if you delete a file that a symbolic link points to, it will not delete a symbolic link
	- the symbolic link will just point to a non-existent file
