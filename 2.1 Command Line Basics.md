#### Basic Shell
![[Pasted image 20240817205633.png]]
- input is sent through `STDIN` (Standard In)
- output is sent to two streams
	- `STDOUT` (Standard Out)
	- `STDERR` (Standard Error)
- streams
	- 0 - `STDIN`
	- 1 - `STDOUT`
	- 2 - `STDERR`
- ex. your output is very verbose and you want some of the output to be piped into a log file
	- you could only show the error stream or vice-versa
	- and then put the stream to write to a log file
- it shows the `#` sign if you are the root user
- shows the `$` if you are not

#### Command Line Syntax
- `ls`
- `ls -lsah` / `ll`

#### Variables
- `$HOME` - home directory
- `$PATH` - path
- `$PS1` - shows the prompt
- `variable_name={value}` - assign variables
- `echo $variable_name` -  access variables
- `var1=$(ls)` - assign command results to variables
