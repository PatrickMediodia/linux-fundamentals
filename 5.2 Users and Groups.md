**User and Group Commands**

**User**
- `/etc/passwd` - check users
- `useradd <usern>`
	- need to be root
	- will get the default permissions
	- a new user created will not have a password
	- the new user will not be able to login to the system unless you give the user a password
	- merely creates a new entry in `/etc/passwd`, does not create a home dir
		- creates a reference to the home directory but does not create it
		- gives a default shell
		- give atleast a home dir and password to every user created
	- `-m` - makes a home directory on user creation
- `passwd <user>` - gives the user a password
-  `usermod <user>`
	- `-s` - set the shell of a user
- `mkhomedir_helper <user>`
	- make a home dir for the user
	- you can also manually do this
- `/etc/skel`
	- boilerplate files and folder for new accounts
	- contents are automatically copied when a new user's home directory is created via the useradd utility

- **User IDs**
	- increases incrementally unless you explicitly specify the user id in the `useradd` command
	- should be unique but not enforced
		- you could create another user with the same userid
		- ex. using ldap in the same range as the usual users
		- there are some security implications as users with the same id are able to access each others files

	- `0` - always the **root** account
	- `1-99` - traditionally reserved for `system` users
	- `100+` - `standard` users
	- `65534` - reserved for `nobody`
		- used to represent a user that has the least amount of permissions on a system
	- that is why when you add a user account and install something that adds a system account, it might be in different ranges
	- a good practice is to allocate a range for local and remote users separately

- Base dir - `/home/`
- Home dir - `/home/<username>`


- `System Users` - are the users that manage your system processes or files
	- `/sbin/nologin` or `/bin/false`
- `Standard Users` - these users are the ones that we login to
- `Remote Users` - ldap or AD

**Groups**
- you can only be a part of one primary group
- you default group will be the one used when you create a new file
- `groups` - shows the groups that a user is currently part of
- `groupadd` - add or create groups
- `usermod -a -G <group> <user>`
	- add a user to a group
	- does not apply to the current session
		- you would have to logout and login to pickup the new changes
		- or reload your profile
- `visudo`
	- add `$<username> ALL=(ALL) ALL` to the `/etc/sudoers` file for that user to be able to use sudo
