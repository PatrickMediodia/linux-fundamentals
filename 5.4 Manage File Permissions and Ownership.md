- if it starts with a `d` it is a directory, else, if it starts with a `-` or something else, it is a file
- you need execute permissions to be able to open a directory

`chmod`
- change/modify file permissions
- grouped into 3
	- owner
	- group
	- others
- permissions
	- `r` - read
	- `w` - write
	- `x` - execute
- changing file permissions
	- `chmod <permissions> <file>`
	- numbers
		- `chmod 777 <file>` - rwx for all users
		- `chmod 755 <file>` - full permissions for the owner and read and execute only for others
	- using symbols
		- `chmod <type><+/i><permissions>`
		- `chmod u+x <file>` - allow the user to execute the file
		- `chmod +rwx <file>` - allow everyone to read write and execute the file, basically 777
		- `chmod g-x <file>` - remove permissions for the group that the file is in to execute it 
		- `chmod o+r <file>` - allow others to read the file
- important numbers
	- `7` - rwx
	- `6` - rw-
	- `5` - r-w
	- `4` - r--

`chown` - change owner
- files have an owner and a group
- `chown <owner>:<group> <file>`
- `chown <owner> <file>` - change owner of the file
- `chown :<group> <file>` - change the group of the file

- user mask - the default permissions given to file a file on creation
